            <h2 class="font-bold">Mood Board</h2>
            <p class="font-med body-text-wrap">A mood board develops after the initial client meeting. During the initial conference, the client answers a series of questions. The questions are for the designer to gauge the client as a person. It can allow them to dig deeper than what is possible from a general conversation. The questions will enable the designer to discover a design direction. The client may not be 100% aware of their wants, and desires are yet. The designer creates a mood board that will visually represent the client. The mood board will be a guide for the designer as well as a reference for the ultimate design direction. </p>

It helps people understand your style and how everything should be used. A style guide can even be helpful to your designers when they are creating different assets for your company, as well. It can be a training guide for new designers that you hire, too; that way, they know the art direction for the company. Even for people who are not designers, it’s helpful to have this book of instructions, so everyone is on the same page." -Happy Beans Design </p>

            <p class="font-med body-text-wrap"> Business opportunities can arise at any time. A well-designed card can set you apart from someone who used a basic template to create their cards. The design chosen for the business card is made with the idea of a good quality paper with a texture that will instantly capture the attention of anyone lucky enough to hold one. The text was placed in the gaps of the golden ratio and finished with a look that seems hand made.  </p>

            <p class="font-med body-text-wrap"> Anytime you need to send documents to a client; there should be no doubt that it came from you. With a professionally designed letterhead, you can let anyone you do business know that they are dealing with a professional individual. Use your letterhead for your resumes, invoice & estimate document, personal project agreements, and more. It adds a personal touch that will not go unnoticed. The same texture exhibited in the business card is also in the final letterhead design.   </p>

<!-- Thank you cards -->

            <h2 class="font-bold">Thank You Card</h2>
            <p class="font-med body-text-wrap"> Client relationships can be fragile. Even if you have a good business relationship with them, they may forget about you in the future. A Thank You card can go a long way to set you apart from the competition and help your current clients become long-term clients. A personal thank you note can also help you land the job when you are one of two remaining candidates. Thank you, notes need to be simple and personal to the recipient. An excellent way to achieve this is to print a basic card template and hand-write a personal message every time you create a new one for a new recipient. </p>
